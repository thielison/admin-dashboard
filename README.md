# Project: Admin Dashboard

This project involved creating a dashboard layout using HTML and CSS. The objective was to design an intuitive and visually appealing interface that effectively organized and presented information. The layout consisted of a sidebar, header, and main-content containers, all utilizing grids for proper arrangement.

The sidebar was developed to provide navigation options and branding elements for easy access to different dashboard sections. The header included a search bar, user information, and action buttons, while the main-content section displayed projects, announcements, and trending items.

The resulting dashboard layout successfully achieved the goal of presenting information in an organized and visually appealing manner. The HTML and CSS code was structured using grids, ensuring a clean and professional design.
